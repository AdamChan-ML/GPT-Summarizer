The application is built using Python and Streamlit and utilizes the Hugging Face transformers library to perform text summarization. In addition, the application supports youtube video summarization which generate summaries of video based on the youtube url link provided by user. The youtube video summarization is developed by using Assembly AI model and API. :)
